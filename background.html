						<h3> In May 2014 southeastern Europe experienced the most damaging floods in <a target="_blank"href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/18/serbia-bosnia-flooding-thousands-flee-river-sava"> over one hundred years</a>. <br><br> Millions of people were affected by the flood and hundreds of thousands were displaced across the region. <br><br>
							<p> Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH), Serbia, and Croatia sustained the most direct damage from the floods.</p></h3>

						<h3> Since the flooding was unexpected, immediate response to the event and evacuation of the victims was difficult.</h3><br>
						<h6> There was also concern that the floodwaters would shift unexploded ordinances (UXOs) that remain from conflicts in the 1990s.  While UXOs did not - fortunately - explode, the floods did move the signs that marked the location of UXOs and <a target="blank" href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2014/05/20/undp-flooding-unearths-landmine-danger-.html">caused landslides, which moved the UXOs to unknown locations</a>.
						<br><br>The map below shows the extent of the flood in BiH, Serbia, and Croatia along with rivers in the region. The Danube is a natural border between most of Croatia and Serbia while the Drina River forms a natural border between BiH and Serbia.<br><br>
						The Sava River follows the border of BiH and Croatia and was the river responsible for the most flooding the region. The Sava and its tributaries, which include the Bosna and the Vasna, caused the most damage to the region.   </h6>

						<h6><a target="blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/05/17/thousands-flee-25-die-in-record-balkan-floods.html">Cyclone Tamara </a> was the source of the flooding and lasted from May 13 to May 15, 2014. <br><br> The immediate disaster response continued through the 19th of May with intense recovery work continuing weeks after.  In some areas, the recovery process is ongoing.   <br><br>
						Hundreds of thousands of residents were displaced, and millions of people were affected. Infrastructures, such as roads, were <a target="blank" href=" http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27459184">damaged </a>throughout the region. A result of the floods, over 2,000 landslides were recorded, and they moved roads, homes, and towns.  Thousands were cut off from clean water. <br><br> The next map shows the path of the Sava River from east (the top of the map) to the west (the bottom) where the Sava meets the Danube in Belgrade. Many more towns were flooded than are shown on this map.The ones shown here provide a context for the extent of the floods and the varied types of damage that occurred.</h6>
